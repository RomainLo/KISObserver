/**
 A category on NSObject that provides an easy-to-use KVO.
 
 You can add an observation of many keypaths at the same time by separating
 them with a '|' when you call an observeObject:forKeyPaths:[*] method.
 Exemple:
 [self observeObject:obj forKeyPaths:@"key1|key2|key3"];
 
 The default options are (NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew | NSKeyValueObservingOptionOld)
 
 The observations are automatically removed when the observer is deallocated.
